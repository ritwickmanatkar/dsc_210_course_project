Dataset

The Goodreads Book Review Dataset, a valuable resource for understanding reader preferences and interactions, encompasses a rich collection of book reviews and user-generated data gathered from the Goodreads website. This dataset, compiled in late 2017, provides insights into the diverse ways readers engage with books and the factors that influence their reading choices.
